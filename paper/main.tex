%% Meta-data block
%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The document title should be given as usual. Some journals require

\title
  {Few-Shot Learning for Low-Data Drug Discovery}

%% Some journals require a list of abbreviations or keywords to be

%% The "tocentry" environment can be used to create an entry for the
%% graphical table of contents. It is given here as some journals
%% require that it is printed as part of the abstract page. It will
%% be automatically moved as appropriate.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{tocentry}

% Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
% This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
% text is correct.

% Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
% 8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
% Society}.

% The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
% permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
% graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
% content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

% This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
% separate page at the end of the document.

% \end{tocentry}

%% The abstract environment will automatically gobble the contents
%% if an abstract is not used by the target journal.

%% The "Acknowledgement" section can be given in all manuscript
%% classes.  This should be given within the "acknowledgement"
%% environment, which will make the correct section or running title.
